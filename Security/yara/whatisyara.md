# what is yara?
```
YARA is an open-source tool used for malware analysis. This tool was developed by Victor Alvarez of VirusTotal. YARA uses a rule-based approach to match patterns of malware characteristics in files. The rules usually contain strings, regular expressions, and special operators that describe certain characteristics of malware families followed by a boolean operation.
